# Zots

It's simple: Blue Zots vs Red Zots. Your mind against your enemy's.

What I use:
- clojure
- clojurescript
- pedestal
- om.next
- datomic + postgresql (at least that's the plan)

Graphical design by: [Kostya C.K.](http://www.altermade.com)

TBU: link to the actual game after it's complete and deployed.
